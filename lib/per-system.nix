      # verdict arrives minutes after the commit is already public -- which is
      # exactly how #3669 (duplicate plan number 0031) and ENG-9863 (a
      # dangling in-page link) each reached main and stayed there. The stages
      # here are the ones cheap enough to run before the push instead.
      #
      # Identity (#3669): within each content directory a four-digit filename
      # prefix is claimed at most once, frontmatter `id` equals the filename
      # stem (stems are unique per directory, so ids stay unique), and a
      # frontmatter `number` agrees with the prefix (the #3668 rename fixed
      # the collision but left the old `number` behind, which kept the site
      # build red).
      #
      # Referential integrity (ENG-9863): every absolute in-page link
      # resolves to a route the site prerenders. Updates are routed at
      # `/<id>`; one `.svx` linking `/updates/<id>` failed `ix-site` on three
      # consecutive main merges. The crawler does catch it, but names the
      # linking ROUTE -- "404 /updates/committed-ix2nix-wasm (linked from
      # /ifd-ix2nix-wasm/)" -- and never the file to edit, so this stage
      # reports path, line, and a suggested route instead.
      #
      # The route inventory is derived, never listed. Static routes are the
      # directories under src/routes owning a `+page`/`+server` file; a
      # dynamic `[id]` directory is expanded with the ids of whichever
      # `$lib/<collection>` its own loader imports. Add a route, rename a
      # collection, or delete a page and the inventory follows. A committed
      # route list would drift, and a link checker that passes a 404 because
      # its inventory is stale is worse than no checker.

  # `check` is the full CI gate as one repo-owned command: check.yml runs
  # `nix run .#check`, so the same two steps run in CI and locally from a single
  # definition. It targets x86_64-linux explicitly because that is the system CI
  # builds for; a linux runner can only pure-eval the cross-platform darwin
  # images, and that cross-eval was most of what made the old single-threaded
  # `nix flake check` slow. `nix` is taken from the ambient PATH on purpose
  # (this is always invoked as `nix run .#check`, so the host's daemon-matched
  # nix is already present); pinning a client nix here could mismatch the host
  # Nix 2.34.x daemon.
  #
  # Step 1 (nix-fast-build) builds every `ciChecks.x86_64-linux` derivation: it
  # evaluates with nix-eval-jobs (parallel) and streams each drv into a build
  # pool as it resolves. --skip-cached drops paths already in a substituter (a
  # warm run does almost no work), --no-nom keeps plain logs, --no-link leaves no
  # result symlinks. It exits nonzero iff a build or eval fails: that is the gate.
  # --eval-workers 16 with --eval-max-memory-size 6144 is a headroom guard rail
  # (above nix-eval-jobs' 4 GiB default per worker, below the old 8 GiB), not a
  # workaround: the per-crate check split (see the `checks` block below) keeps
  # each worker's eval bounded by the largest single crate. Both binaries are
  # nix-fast-build is the repo-built nixpkgs 1.5.0 package with a patch that
  # makes --skip-cached skip a `local` (warm-store) output, not just a remotely
  # `cached` one. nix-eval-jobs is built against the fleet daemon's stable Nix
  # 2.34 protocol family rather than nixpkgs' moving default. The eval
  # cache is disabled for the parallel evaluator: all workers share one
  # per-flake SQLite database, so writes contend and can fail with "database is
  # busy" without providing useful hits on a fresh commit. See the $fast_build
  # and $eval_jobs comments below.
  #
  # Step 2 (nix-eval-jobs) is the schema/eval gate over the package outputs,
  # broader than the `checks` set step 1 built. nix-eval-jobs is the same
  # parallel evaluator nix-fast-build wraps; run eval-only over
  # packages.x86_64-linux it spreads per-attribute eval across 16 workers and
  # realizes IFD (the `site` import-npm-lock source) on demand. Each worker is a
  # full evaluator that can grow to the 4 GiB-per-worker cap and the host runs
  # many CI jobs at once, so 16 both bounds memory and already collapses the eval
  # toward the slowest single attribute (warm store, eval-cache off: 342s at 1
  # worker, 75s at 16, 70s at 32). The eval cache is off because it is keyed per
  # commit (it never hits on a fresh CI commit) and parallel workers otherwise
  # contend writing the same per-commit sqlite ("database is busy"). The
  # resulting cold per-commit re-eval is tracked separately; a flake eval cache
  # would amortize it. nix-eval-jobs
  # reports a per-attribute eval failure as a JSON `error` line and still exits 0,
  # so the gate is the error-line check; a startup or lock failure exits nonzero
  # and aborts the run (Nushell propagates external failures like bash
  # `set -o pipefail`). Uses the repo-built nix-eval-jobs directly by store path
  # rather than `nix run`.
  #
  # `check required` is the required PR path. It builds the namespaced union of
  # ciChecks and cachePushRoots through one 16-worker evaluator pool, then runs
  # the package schema gate. This replaces two competing self-hosted claims
  # without running two 16-worker clients side by side (which has OOM-killed a
  # 96 GiB runner before). `check closure` remains the manual closure probe.
  #
  # Refused at evaluation when this flake carries no guest Nix (`ix.nixPackage`
  # is null: index evaluated standalone, which is what the public mirror's
  # check.yml does). Every mode below forces image closures -- `main` through
  # `ciChecks` (`eval`, `base-image-nix-db`, `nvim-startup`) and the package
  # schema pass over `base`/`vcfs-guest-eval`, `main required` through every
  # `closure-*` root of `requiredGateRoots` -- and each of those throws
  # `modules/profiles/base: no guest Nix was injected` when forced. Letting the
  # gate run would spend a 16-worker evaluator pool discovering that one
  # refusal per image, then report the images as failed checks. One refusal
  # here names where the gate actually runs instead.

        index cannot assemble that Nix on its own (lib/default.nix `nixPackage`: the jj tree ABI archive the fork links lives in the ix repository). ix instantiates this flake with it (`index.withNixPackage`, ix nix/flake/outputs/workspace.nix `index`) and its required gate absorbs `requiredGateRoots.x86_64-linux` as the `index-*` jobs of `packages.x86_64-linux.required-ci-checks`. Run the gate there, or evaluate one root through ix's `index` flake output.

  # dominate the run -- each is one uncompressed blob that never dedups, cold
  # every run since check.yml only eval-validates packages:
  #
  #   1. Every NixOS image is replaced by its `toplevel` closure -- the artifact
  #      `ix apply` substitutes (consumers reconstruct the archive on demand via
  #      streamLayeredImage). Non-image packages, and non-NixOS OCI images (which
  #      expose no `toplevel`), pass through unchanged. See lib/image/oci-layer.nix.
  #   2. The `health-checks{,-zellij}` runners pin every fleet node's
  #      `toplevel` closure as a build dep (lib/image/health-checks.nix); the
  #      per-example `health-check-*` wrappers live in `legacyPackages`, not

  #      `cargo-units.nix`, its `cargo-unit-graph.json`, and the vendor dir a Mac

  #      build-time deps of the cross packages, so they are absent from those
  #      packages' runtime closures; adding them as roots is the fix for #1687.
  #      `workspacePackageIfdRoots` extends this to any package that rides a
  #      second `buildWorkspace` (codex's codex-rs; ix2nix-wasm's wasm32
  #      graph, which pre-#4125 scaffolded `ix init` evals still force by
  #      interpolating the package output into `converter`, #4127), whose

  #      `crossWorkspace` -- does not see.
  #   4. On Darwin hosts, the native lane's eval-time IFD outputs
  #      (`nativeIfdRoots`): the same three unit-graph artifacts as (3) but for
  #      the host's own target, which a Darwin consumer forces at eval when it
  #      evaluates any native wrapper (codex, claude-code) against the workspace
  #      unit graph. Runtime closures never carry them, so without explicit
  #      roots every Darwin consumer re-vendors and re-renders the graph at
  #      eval -- the same trap as (3), for the darwin cache lane (#1890).
