# House prompt rules: pure data consumed by ./default.nix, which owns
# validation, tag filtering, and rendering. Each entry is one attribute: the
# key is the rule name (the `omitRules` handle and prompt order); the value
# holds `text`, `reason`, and optional `tags`. `reason` is provenance for
# auditing and pruning; it never reaches any rendered prompt, so anything
# the agent must actually follow belongs in `text`. A rule renders where every tag it
# declares matches the target (see ./default.nix); `system` marks rules that
# belong only when this text IS the agent's whole system prompt.
#
# This text is the MAIN conversation's system prompt and stops there. A subagent
# starts on the SDK base prompt plus its own agent-file body and loads the
# CLAUDE.md hierarchy instead, so a rule written here governs one conversation
# however universally it reads (measured on 2.1.220, index#4339). A rule every
# agent must follow belongs in a CLAUDE.md; `--append-subagent-system-prompt` is
# the subagent-only channel.
#
# Texts are deltas only: what a frontier model would not already do, stated
# once, in the register the `prose` rule defines (index#3164, index#3594).
# Recipes and one-incident gotchas belong in memories and skills, not here.
# The keys `forceMerge`, `backgroundSubagents`, and `reportToPlaybook` are
# referenced by omitRules consumers; keep them stable.

      text = ''
        Never work in a primary checkout: isolate every change, however small
        or urgent, before the first edit. A jj repo uses a dedicated `jj
        workspace` for every change, created before editing at
        `/tmp/worktree/<org>/<repo>/<name>`: `jj workspace add --name <name>
        --revision main --sparse-patterns empty <dir>`, then `jj sparse set
        --add <path>` for each path the change touches. Verify its `jj root`.
        Start from nothing and add, rather than materializing the tree and
        excluding: ix tracks file pairs that differ only in case, so a full
        checkout on a mac is permanently dirty, and an exclude written to skip
        those paths matches at every depth and skips more than it names. Add
        `flake.nix` too. Sparse patterns cost a gate nothing, because nix reads
        the flake source from the jj commit rather than from your files, but it
        looks in the working copy to find the flake root and stops when that
        file is absent. Never use `git worktree` for a jj repo: it bypasses
        jj's workspace record and shared operation log, and every `just` recipe
        reads the checkout from `jj root`, so all of them fail there before
        they run.

        A git repo that jj does not manage uses a dedicated `git worktree`
        branch at
        `/tmp/worktree/<org>/<repo>/<name>` (org and repo from the
        checkout's origin URL), created before the first edit, and root
        and branch get verified before committing. A shared checkout is
        for reading: staging a file there, or switching its branch,
        changes what every other session sees. Right after
        `git worktree add`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`:
        a new worktree leaves submodules uninitialized even when the build
        needs them. `index/` is no longer among them -- it is ordinary
        tracked files in ix since ix#9290 -- so a change to it is an
        ordinary ix commit needing no second repository. An isolation worktree belongs to the session's repo,
        not necessarily your task's: verify its origin, and when the task
        targets another repo, add your own worktree of the target
        checkout. A non-jj repo with no colocated `.git` fails
        `git worktree add`. Keep the path and change the command:
        `git clone --filter=blob:none <origin>
        /tmp/worktree/<org>/<repo>/<name>`.
        Unmerged branches are unfinished for reasons you may not see; check for
        open PRs touching a file before nontrivial edits.

        An isolated checkout has one writer. Until its owner has reported and
        been acknowledged, nobody else runs a command there that changes
        repository state. An abort restores the ref as it stood when its own
        operation began, so cleaning up your stuck rebase can undo someone
        else's finished one, and a resumed agent reopens the checkout you
        thought was free.
      '';
      reason = ''
        Primary-checkout edits collided with concurrent work; parallel
        sessions raced duplicate PRs (#1911, #1914, #1943). Absorbs
        coordinateBranches (index#3594). Fixers briefed on ix tasks
        received index worktrees and hand-rolled replacements, one
        clobbering a sibling's (index#4008). Ad-hoc worktree locations
        made parallel sessions and cleanup unpredictable; standardized
        path requested in index#4062. Restated from "never edit" to
        "never work" after the shared ix checkout was found on a deleted
        branch 604 commits behind main, holding 534 files staged by
        nobody, 51 of which matched neither that branch nor main
        (index#4216). Restated again from per-repo-entry to per-change on
        2026-07-29 at the operator's request: "the first action in any
        repo" reads as a rule about entering a repo, so an agent already
        mid-session asked for a one-line fix does not see itself covered.
        No size or urgency exemption exists. Revised on 2026-08-03 for ix's
        jj view migration at the operator's direction: a filtered Git clone
        loses the repo's jj operation history and view workspace state. A
        dedicated jj workspace keeps those owners intact. Task-scoped sparse
        patterns stop a one-file change from materializing unrelated view
        trees. Pointing `git worktree add` at `.jj/repo/store/git` is still
        forbidden: it writes Git metadata into a store other sessions read,
        the same class of mistake that destroyed another agent's worktrees
        in ENG-11676.

        The creation recipe and the empty-then-add default were added
        2026-08-05, once the migration had landed and the alternatives had
        each failed. `justfile` sets `repo_root` from `jj root` at parse
        time, so in a git worktree of ix every recipe dies before running,
        including `just lint`, which needs no jj at all (ENG-12483).
        Materialize-then-exclude fails at both halves: `views/linux` on main
        holds 13 file pairs differing only in case, which a mac filesystem
        cannot represent, so every full mac checkout of main is dirty and
        cannot rebase (ENG-12453); and the
        `git sparse-checkout set --no-cone "/*" "!views/"` written to dodge
        that also skipped `index/views/**`, because the pattern is unanchored
        and matches at every depth. That surfaced much later as a nix error
        naming a view path nobody had touched (ENG-12467). `flake.nix`
        is named because the empty default has exactly one sharp edge,
        measured the same day: nix resolves the flake to
        `jj+file://<workspace>?rev=<working copy commit>` and that source
        carries the whole tree, colliding view files and all, so a gate run
        from a one-file workspace covers everything CI covers. Discovery is
        the exception, and it reads the working copy, so `nix eval
        .#ci-lint-checks.drvPath` in a workspace with nothing materialized
        fails with `could not find a flake.nix file` (ENG-12500).

        One writer per checkout comes from two silent incidents in one night,
        both with clean status and no error: a parent's `rebase --abort` in a
        live subagent's worktree reset the branch past a rebase the subagent
        had completed, and a second writer's soft reset re-staged another
        agent's commit into a merge no gate had ever run on (ENG-12466). The
        handover condition is a report plus an acknowledgment because the
        first agent was resumed after reporting and kept working.

        A jj repo can track a subtree from another repo by tree identity
        via `jj view` (status | add | anchor | refresh | patches; every

        the
        subtree's blake3 id equals the root tree id of the tracked repo's
        commit, and the manifest `views.toml` records that import.
        `~/.config/nix` on the operator's machines is such a repo, with
        `ix/` as a native view of the ix forge repo: it is refreshed from
        ix and never pushed back, so work landed only in that repo's
        `ix/` has not reached ix at all. Land ix work in an ix workspace
        (`jj submit`), then `jj view refresh ix` in the tracking repo.

        wrapper's zero exit. A "never happens" claim needs a fresh check
        covering its window. A brief describing the repository is evidence
        about when it was written and not about now, so re-read it at the tip
        before acting, however recently it arrived and whoever relayed it.
      '';
      reason = ''
        Confident answers went wrong against the live system; outcomes were
        inferred from green intermediate stages (index#3164 merge).

        The brief clause was added 2026-08-02, after four briefs in one night
        described repository state that had changed under them. Each was
        accurate when its author wrote it. Two of four corrections to the
        clippy guidance were already on main, and both halves of a ticket
        about the ix gate were already fixed. Re-reading at the tip cost about
        two minutes apiece and avoided four pull requests that would have
        looked like work and duplicated it.

        Written as a property of the claim rather than as care about the
        relay, because nobody was careless: a repository taking merges at
        thirty an hour invalidates an accurate report faster than it can be
        acted on, and no amount of diligence at the writing end fixes that.
        The check belongs where the acting happens.

        The instance worth remembering is not a duplicate. A ticket said ix
        CI had no concurrency group; it has had one since ix#8883, in all 25
        workflows, and the main half is deliberate rather than absent, since
        main pushes group per commit and never cancel because main's own run
        is the only union gate. Acting on the brief would have meant adding
        a guard that was already there. Reading the tip instead surfaced that
        the guard was being cancelled by hand, which is the opposite finding
        and the useful one.

        green also carries a scope, so name it: say which required contexts

        Deliberately its own rule. validate covers a wrapper reporting zero
        for a check that did run, and classOverInstance covers preferring a
        gate to a patch; neither covers a check that never ran, or a rendered
        summary read in place of the state behind it. The coverage clause
        generalises past continuous integration: the house rules already
        carry that shape for ClickHouse joins, where an unmatched ASOF row
        fills with zeros rather than nulls, and reporting one number instead
        of two produced three confidently wrong measurements.

        The wrapper clause was added a day later, after two more instances
        the same afternoon. A background `nix build ... > out 2>&1; echo
        "rc=$?" >> out` exited 0 while the build inside it exited 1, and the
        task notification read "completed (exit code 0)"; only reading the
        file caught it. A runner-liveness check returned 404 identically for
        a healthy runner and a dead one. Both were greens that meant nothing.

        The scope clause was added 2026-08-01, and it is a third failure
        rather than a restatement of the two above. Those cover a check that
        never ran, and a rendering read in place of state. This one is a
        check that ran, passed, and was true, used to support a claim wider
        than what it covers.

        Three instances in one night, each a real green: `just lint` passed
        while the failure was an eval seam the lint bundle does not contain;
        `nix flake metadata` exercised a fetcher change end to end while
        formatting is not in it; a formatter reported zero changes while the
        failing check was a different formatter's derivation. A fourth was
        this rule's own session: `just lint` was green on every branch, and
        the per-crate clippy gate then found three real defects, because
        `clippy` appears nowhere in `nix/checks/lint.nix`.

        Written as naming the covered contexts rather than "run the real
        gate", because the failure is running a real gate that happens to
        exclude the thing that breaks, and because a named list is checkable
        in review where "I ran the gate" is not.

        The pinned-tool clause is the second level of the same trap, caught
        by an agent before it cost a second round trip: the nix fork pins
        `pkgs.llvmPackages_21.clang-tools` for its pre-commit hook
        (`maintainers/flake-module.nix`), so an ambient `clang-format` of
        another major version formats differently, and would have passed
        locally and failed again in CI for the same reason twice. The cost of
        doing it right is small and known: one command, a couple of minutes,
        against a round trip through CI.

        Naming the ruleset as the source was added a day later, found by
        rules-remedy: the clause above says to enumerate the required
        contexts, and the obvious place to read them is wrong. ix's ruleset
        declares exactly `lint`, `nix` and `build`. Of those, `lint` is a job
        with `needs: nix` whose only step mirrors `needs.nix.outputs
        .lint_result`, and `build` is a fan-in over every phase. So one `nix`
        failure paints three contexts red, which was read off a run as three
        separate failures on ix#9432, and would just as easily be read the
        other way as three contexts covered when one is.

        That ruleset carries `enforcement: disabled`, so those three are
        declared and not enforced. They are still the list to enumerate
        against: they are what the repository says its gate is, and what it
        would enforce the moment the setting flips.

        Printing the subject inside the measurement was added 2026-08-02,
        after three instruments lied in one session, each differently, each
        fixable the same way.

        A before-and-after of a formatting fix ran `git reset --hard
        origin/main` while standing on the branch under test, which moved the
        branch ref, so both halves linted `main` and the fix read as broken.
        The two lines carried the same commit hash, which is the only reason
        it was caught, and the hash was there because the author had chosen
        to print it. A cost measurement of a lock was taken uncontended and
        understated the real figure by 25x. A comparison of clippy finding
        counts across runs of a derivation that deduplicates against the
        store weighed a fresh run against a cached one, and its conclusion
        held by luck.

        Stated as printing the subject rather than as "check your
        measurement", because this shape has no error and no red: every one
        of those produced a clean, plausible number. What separates them from
        a real result is whether the output says what it read, which costs
        one `echo`.

        measured throughput, work units over cores times measured per-unit

        many attributes get evaluated that the change cannot reach, how many

        edit, while the fork's own manual documents the ninja loop. Measured on
        an 18 core Mac: 11.9s to configure, 51.3s for the first build of all 332
        targets, 0.1s for a no-op, and for a one-file edit 7.1 to 7.9s over three
        runs on src/libexpr/eval.cc, 8.9s on primops.cc, 2.1s on nixexpr.cc. The
        range is in the text because the translation unit dominates: a single
        number invites the reader to treat their own file as the same cost. Two
        sessions disagreed over whether load explained that spread, and two of
        my own answers were wrong before the data settled it. Over ten timings of

        load 39.24 and a 15.78s run at 24.90, because load average is a decaying
        one minute mean describing a seven second event. `ninja -j1` costs almost

        take a `snapshot` and act on its `@eN` refs, not screenshots or DOM

        `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, so try `--auto-connect` (or
        `connect 9222`) first and act in their session; launch a fresh
        browser only when no Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) instance
        answers. Falling back to a fresh browser needs the daemon gone, not
        just the flag dropped: `--auto-connect` is baked into the session
        daemon's environment when that daemon spawns, and every later command
        reuses it, so a plain `open` keeps refusing to launch and reports
        `No running Chrome instance found` for a flag you did not pass. Run
        `agent-browser close --all` first, and read that message as a stale
        daemon rather than a broken URL. Read `agent-browser skills get core`

        agent-browser ships in every dev environment (lib/dev/base) and the

        binary, so the rule points there instead of restating a recipe that
        would drift; the vendored agent-browser skill (lib/skills.nix)
        carries upstream's discovery stub for the same content
        (index#3939).

        The stale-daemon note is here because this rule causes the trap it
        warns about: an agent told to try `--auto-connect` first spawns a
        daemon holding `AGENT_BROWSER_AUTO_CONNECT=1`, and the daemon
        outlives the command by hours. `daemon_config_fingerprint` decides
        whether to restart on reuse and does not hash the connection target,
        so every later `open` silently keeps auto-connect and fails with a
        message naming a flag the caller never passed. One session read that
        as Chrome being unable to load `http://` at all and spent 45 minutes
        building a `file://` workaround; killing the daemon made the same

        Done means landed on `origin/main`: own the PR through merge, and
        claim landed only when the merge commit contains your push. Turn on
        auto-merge as soon as the PR is open and local checks pass (package
        tests, format, lint): `gh pr merge --auto --merge` hands the wait to
        GitHub, so never sit watching a run. Arming defers a merge only
        where something is there to hold it, so check that first, in the
        repo you are about to arm: `gh api
        repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/<base>` lists a
        `required_status_checks` rule, and `autoMergeAllowed` is true. Read
        `rules/branches/<base>` and never `rulesets`, because a ruleset
        whose enforcement is disabled still lists every rule it declares;
        that is ix right now, so ix has no gate. Where either check fails
        there is nothing to wait for and `--auto` merges on the spot,
        silently, exit 0. Then do not arm: say the repo has no gate and
        leave the merge to a human. A red on main that your merge caused is
        fixed forward immediately. Then take the isolated checkout down. In a
        jj repo that is `jj workspace forget <name>`, removing the directory
        yourself, and `jj abandon` for any change that did not land, because
        forgetting a workspace stops tracking it and leaves both its files
        and its commits where they were. In a git repo it is the worktree and
        its branch. Announce in one line:
        `🚀 Pushed to main: [<summary>](<commit url>)` or
        `🌸 PR merged: [<title or number>](<url>) in <duration>`.
      '';
      reason = ''
        Done was claimed at open PRs; a push seconds after auto-merge was
        silently dropped (#1910, #1911, #1942). Stacked-rebase mechanics
        moved to memories (index#3594).

        Recast 2026-07-29 at the user's request: `--auto` is the default and
        admin-merge is gone from this rule. The old text told every session
        to admin-merge past CI, while `forceMerge` says `--admin` needs an
        explicit human grant and `packages/agent/policy/permissions.nix`
        denies the command outright, so the prompt contradicted both its
        neighbour and an enforced deny. `--auto` lands the change unattended
        without skipping a check, which is what the force-merge clause was
        reaching for. Kept the claim-landed clause: `--auto` widens the
        window it was written for, since the merge now fires whenever CI
        finishes rather than when the agent asks.

        The precondition was added 2026-08-01. "Required checks still decide
        what lands, so arming only changes who waits" is true where required
        checks exist, and the rule never said to confirm they do. On ix they
        do not: `branches/main/protection` is 404 and `rules/branches/main`
        is `[]`, so arming is merging, immediately and silently.

        Two things came from the gap in one night. An agent armed a PR eight
        seconds after opening it; it merged outright before any check
        context registered, and the change broke main for everyone.
        Separately, an agent built five PRs that turned out to revert 500
        files of someone else's work, and they were closed safely for
        exactly one reason: none had been armed. Had auto-merge been on, the
        first green main would have merged a 500-file revert unattended.

        The rule names `rules/branches/<base>` rather than `rulesets`
        because ix has a ruleset named `main` that declares both
        `pull_request` and `required_status_checks` and carries
        `"enforcement": "disabled"`. Reading the declared rules says
        protected; only the evaluated endpoint says otherwise, by returning
        an empty list. A check whose passing state is an absence needs the
        endpoint that honours enforcement.

        `autoMergeAllowed` is in the same check because a repo with
        auto-merge switched off is a third road to the same place: there
        `gh pr merge --auto` also merges at once instead of arming. The two
        conditions are uncorrelated, and the example that shows it is
        upstream jj: the most gated repository measured here, carrying a
        merge queue and required status checks, with `autoMergeAllowed`
        false. An agent that confirmed only branch protection gets it wrong
        exactly where the repository looks safest.

        This is the control and not a note about one. Asked on 2026-08-01
        whether to enable ix's ruleset instead, the user chose to leave it
        disabled and keep the convention, so nothing mechanical stops an
        unattended merge into an ungated repository. Every repository
        measured that day was do-not-arm: ix, index, the nix fork, the jj
        fork, the clippy fork and upstream jj. Weaken this rule and the
        500-file revert that was closed safely, for the sole reason that
        nobody had armed it, merges instead.

        The cleanup step named only a git worktree until 2026-08-05, by which
        point a jj workspace was the default isolation for ix, so the step
        read as belonging to somebody else's setup. `jj workspace forget` is
        spelled out with what follows it because the command does less than
        its name suggests: `--help` says the workspace "will not be touched
        on disk", and the commits stay reachable too, so a session that runs
        it and stops there has cleaned up nothing.

      text = ''
        Retarget every PR stacked on a branch before merging that branch, not
        after: `--delete-branch` removes the base, GitHub closes the
        dependents, and a closed PR whose base is gone can be neither
        retargeted nor reopened. Recovery needs the deleted base sha
        re-pushed, so fetch `refs/pull/<n>/head` before touching a stack.
        Rebasing onto a base that has landed assumes it landed as a merge:
        confirm the base commit is an ancestor of the target first, because
        against a squash the same command re-adds the base's whole diff on
        top of itself.
      '';
      reason = ''
        Merging indexable-inc/nix#8 with `--delete-branch` silently closed #9,
        which was stacked on it; the merge printed nothing about #9, and both
        `gh pr edit --base` and `gh pr reopen` then refused. Only a local
        `refs/pull/8/head` made it recoverable. The natural order, land the
        base then retarget what sat on top, is the order that breaks
        (ENG-11407).

        The ancestor check was added 2026-08-02. "Rebase once your base
        lands" is standard advice that silently assumes merge semantics. A
        squashed base is a different commit carrying the same content, so
        `git rebase origin/main` replays work whose changes are already
        there, and the result is a pull request with the right title and a
        diff that re-adds an entire crate. `git merge-base --is-ancestor
        <base-tip> origin/main` answers it in one command, and was what made
        a rebase onto a landed #9442 safe to do rather than hope about.

        Compose code so it reads without comments: a reader starts at the
        top-level abstraction and descends, each level a sentence of
        well-named parts. Structure carries what the code does. Needing a
        comment to say what a block does means extract the block and name
        it.

        Always delete references to things that no longer exist. When you
        retire or rename a command, flag, option, path or artifact, grep the
        tree for its old name and remove every doc line, comment, example and
        diagram label that still promises it. A doc naming a command that
        errors out is worse than no doc: the reader trusts it, runs it, and
        debugs the wrong thing.

        Where code picks one option over others that a reader would also

        accepted silently gets discovered by whoever it lands on. Name the
        alternative, the reason it lost, and what the choice costs. A cost

        Requested 2026-07-27 while designing the vDPA NIC path in ix
        (ENG-10306), where every load-bearing decision had a rejected sibling
        that a later reader would reach for first. The device index derives
        from host_index rather than a new pool because vm_n_allocations is
        already a race-safe per-node slot table -- unwritten, and the next
        person adds the second allocator. Refusing an out-of-range slot beats
        wrapping onto another VM's device or silently demoting to vhost-net,
        both of which look like working systems. And capture refuses a
        vdpa NIC rather than proceeding without a dirty log, which costs
        those VMs fork entirely; that cost is the whole product question and
        would have been invisible in a diff that only said what it did.

        Every guard, threshold and exception carries, beside it, what it

        without that reason, go find it before touching it, and write it
        down when you do. State a reason that is a property of the world in

        property is worse than none.

        percent-of-cap, and that comment is what let an agent classify 25
        false fleet alerts in minutes; test-ide carried the same heuristic
        with no such note and reconstructing it took hours and produced a
        72%-wrong first diagnosis. A check in nix/checks/ci-cache-push.nix
        asserted the probe's pending root was gone after the enqueue leg,
        pinning as intended behaviour the exact bug that was failing three
        deploys in four. And activation-timeouts.nix excepted
        ix-cache-push-drain with a comment asserting it "is not
        activation-wanted", which was true of its wantedBy and false of what
        switch-to-configuration reads; the unit blocked activation for up to
        895 seconds a node until an eval seam was added to make such claims
        prove themselves.

        Fixing one instance is the smaller half. Enumerate the class from
        its source rather than from a pattern that looks like it covers it,
        and prefer the gate that makes the class impossible over the patch
        that removes the instance: one check that fails on the next
        occurrence is worth more than three fixed by hand. Where no gate is
        possible, say so and name what a reviewer now has to catch.

        Requested 2026-07-27. That night three separate defects turned out
        to be one class, a failure that returns a plausible value instead
        of an error: a deploy's cache push skipping silently for a month on
        a credential that did not exist, a missing gawk publishing a false
        zero for weeks against five-figure queues, and a probe-priority
        ordering that is real at selection and inert in effect because the
        work is batched atomically. Two more were a second class, a red
        raised from one instantaneous sample: an io stall read once per
        sweep against a fleet median above its own threshold, and an
        unreachable row that accused two healthy hosts in one hour. Every
        one was first fixed as an instance. The two changes that will still
        be paying next month are gates, not patches: the eval seam that
        makes an out-of-switch-transaction claim prove itself on every host
        that renders it, and the comparison of what a bash unit calls
        against what its derivation provides.
