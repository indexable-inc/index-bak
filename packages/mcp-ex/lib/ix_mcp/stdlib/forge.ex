defmodule IxMcp.Stdlib.Forge do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Landing a change on the forge's protected `main`, and waiting for the
  verdict that says whether it landed.

  The forge's merge queue is the only way onto a protected bookmark: `submit`
  writes an operation carrying the intent, the CI reconciler rebases the
  change onto whatever `main` has become, runs the gate against the REBASED
  commit, and moves the bookmark on a pass. Everything hard about landing is
  downstream of that rebase.

  ## Provenance

  2026-08-12. Four lanes landed changes through this queue on one day, each
  working from its own retyped copy of the recipe, and every copy grew a
  different fault:

    * a typo in the submit verb, so the submit never happened and the lane
      waited on a queue it was not in;
    * a waiter polling `queue.json` for ABSENCE, which is a lagging snapshot
      -- an entry can be missing while the run is live, so the poll reported
      a landing that had not happened;
    * a comparison fed by a `sort` under the ambient locale, which orders
      fractional epochs by their integer part and picks the wrong newest
      record;
    * a heredoc feeding a pipe, where the writing stage's failure was
      invisible because a pipeline reports only its last stage.

  None of those four faults was a misunderstanding of the forge. Each was an
  artifact of RETYPING a procedure that already existed and had already been
  debugged. This module is that procedure, once, so the next lane copies a
  call instead of a recipe.

  Two more corrections are encoded here because they are silent rather than
  loud, which makes them worse:

    * The verdict search keys on `change_id`, never on the commit id held
      before submitting. The queue rebases, so the pre-submit commit id
      appears in no run record, and a waiter keyed on it waits forever with
      no error.
    * `change_id` is keyed in its 32-HEX form. jj prints change ids in
       reverse-hex letters (`z..k` for `0..f`), the run records store hex,
       and grepping the letter form finds nothing forever -- also silently.
       `change_id_hex/1` and `change_id_letters/1` convert, and are pinned
       by a test against ids verified against live run records.

  ## What a verdict is, and what it is not

  `await_verdict/1` returns `{:passed, report}` or `{:failed, report}` only
  for `passed` and `failed`. An `interrupted` attempt immediately returns
  `{:indeterminate, report}` because it ended without a CI verdict. Other
  unresolved states become indeterminate when waiting ends, including the CI
  consumer being dead. A waiter that cannot tell "nobody is draining the
  queue" from "still building" reports the first as the second forever, so
  liveness is a leg of the answer rather than a footnote
  (`IxMcp.Forge.Runs.consumer/2`).

  ## Configuration

  This tree is public and a forge host is a specific machine, so no host,
  path or URL is compiled in. Landing needs all four; reading verdicts needs
  only the first.

    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_CI` -- `[user@host:]<runs-dir>`, the reconciler's run
      records, shared with `IxMcp.Forge.Verdicts`.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_LAND` -- `[user@host:]<workspace-root>`, a directory on
      the forge host under which each land gets its own fresh clone.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_JJ` -- absolute path to the forge-aware `jj` binary on
      that host.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_SERVER` -- the forge's RPC URL.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_UNIT` -- the CI reconciler's systemd unit, for the
      liveness leg. Defaults to `jj-forge-ci`.

  ## A tree whose only content is this land

  By default `land/2` clones into a new directory every time. A carried-over
  workspace can hold the previous land's working-copy commit, its stale index,
  or a half-applied change, and the failure that produces looks like a defect in
  the change being landed rather than in the workspace. What the fresh clone
  buys is a tree whose only content is what this call put there, which is also
  what makes the path-tier check meaningful.

  That property, not the download, is the requirement, so `:workspace` may point
  at an already-materialized clone and it is verified rather than trusted: no
  changes in the working copy, no description on `@`, or the land is refused.
  The download is 3.4 GB and 13 to 26 minutes, and the first four attempts to
  land this module all died AFTER it, on faults it had nothing to do with.

  The clone is not the only thing that has to stay out of the tree: the commit
  message file and the `:expect` pre-images are written BESIDE the workspace,
  never inside it, or the tier check would see them as paths this land is trying
  to ship.

  Land `change` on the forge's `main` and wait for its verdict.

  Options:

    * `:author` -- `[name: ..., email: ...]`, required. An unattributed
      commit can otherwise land, and there is no fixing that afterwards.
    * `:allow_prefixes` -- path prefixes the commit may touch, default
      `["index/"]`. Every changed path is checked against these AFTER the
      files are written, from jj's own diff rather than from the caller's
      list, because the point is to catch what the tree gained and not what
      the caller meant.
    * `:target` -- the bookmark to land on, default `"main"`.
    * `:workspace` -- adopt an already-materialized clone instead of making a
      fresh one, for a retry that should not pay for a 3.4 GB download twice.
      Refused unless the workspace is provably unused: no changes, no
      description.
    * `:run`, `:put` -- test seams for remote execution and remote file writes.
    * `:on_submit` -- a one-argument function called with the report (change id
      in both forms, commit id, workspace, files) the moment the submit is
      accepted, before the verdict wait begins.
    * `:expect` -- `%{path => contents}` for every path that ALREADY exists on
      the target bookmark. A whole-file write cannot tell a rebase from a
      revert, so a file present in the clone is refused unless the caller
      states what it expected to find; `overwrite: true` skips the check.
    * `:dry_run` -- do everything up to and including the describe, then
      return `{:dry_run, report}` without submitting. The whole pipeline
      minus the queue slot.
    * `:timeout_ms`, `:interval_ms` -- passed to `await_verdict/1`.
    * `:run` -- a `(target, argv, opts -> {:ok, output} | {:error, detail})`
      seam, so the sequence is testable without a forge.

  Returns `{:passed, report}` when the gate passed and the bookmark moved,
  `{:failed, report}` with the failing derivations named, `{:indeterminate,
  report}` when no verdict could be established, or `{:error, detail}` when
  the land could not be attempted at all.

  Options:

    * `:change_id` -- the change to wait for, in 32-hex or in jj's letter
      form (either is accepted and converted). A prefix is enough.
    * `:subject` -- alternative key: the first line of the commit message,
      matched against the record's `trigger.description`. Useful when the
      change id was not captured, and weaker, because two changes can share
      a subject.
    * `:since` -- how far back to read records, default five minutes before
      now. A run record is found by its content, not by this window; the
      window only bounds the read.
    * `:timeout_ms` (default one hour), `:interval_ms` (default 20s).
