defmodule IxMcp.Forge.Runs do
  @moduledoc """
  The forge CI reconciler's run records, and the one reader over them.

  A gate run writes `<runs-dir>/<commit12>-<epoch_ms>/progress.json` and
  rewrites it on status transitions and historical reconciliation. Only
  `passed` and `failed` carry CI verdicts; `interrupted` records an ended
  attempt without a verdict. Its mtime is the rewrite time. Two consumers
  read those records -- `IxMcp.Forge.Verdicts` sweeps them by mtime to announce verdicts
  nobody asked for, and `IxMcp.Stdlib.Forge` waits on the one record
  belonging to a change it just submitted -- so the reader lives here and a
  correction to it lands once instead of twice.

  ## Two instruments that must never be used instead

    * `queue.json` is a LAGGING snapshot: an entry can be absent from it
      while its run is live, so "not in the queue" never means "not landed".
      A poll for absence reports a landing that has not happened.
    * `jj forge dump` is authoritative and takes 100-160s under load
      while holding the repo, which is longer than any sane poll cadence.

  A historical record describes an attempt. It does not establish current
  process ownership or prove that a change landed.

  ## The commit id in the directory name is the REBASED one

  The queue rebases a submit onto whatever `main` has become, so the commit
  id a submitter holds is not the commit id the run directory is named after,
  and searching for the pre-submit id finds nothing forever. The record's
  `change_id` survives the rebase, which is why that is the key callers are
  given (`IxMcp.Stdlib.Forge.await_verdict/1`), in the 32-hex form the record
  stores rather than jj's reverse-hex letters.

  ## Failing closed

  A read reports its own failure rather than an empty answer: an absent runs
  directory exits 3 and a broken `find` exits 4, both distinguishable from
  "no new runs", which is exit 0 with no output. `find`'s status is checked
  explicitly because a shell pipeline reports only its last stage, so with
  `find` dead the pipeline still exits 0 and its empty output is
  byte-identical to a quiet window.
