defmodule IxMcp.Forge.Verdicts do
  @moduledoc """
  The forge CI feed: a gate run that reaches a verdict becomes one channel
  line, so a session learns that main went green or red without asking.

  The ask this answers is a measured failure, not a nicety. CI verdicts were
  pull-only, so an agent that had submitted a change had two options: block
  on a waiter, or come back later and guess. Twice on 2026-08-12 a session
  guessed wrong and recorded a landing that had not happened. A verdict that
  arrives on its own removes the guess.

  ## Where the facts come from

  `IxMcp.Forge.Runs` owns reading the reconciler's per-run `progress.json`
  records and pulling detail out of a gate's `log_tail`; it also documents
  why `queue.json` and `jj forge dump` are the wrong instruments and how the
  read fails closed. This module is one of its two consumers: it sweeps by
  file mtime, because a record is rewritten when its status changes, so the
  mtime includes newly completed runs and historical reconciliation. Only
  `passed` and `failed` are announced; `interrupted` has no CI verdict.
  The other consumer, `IxMcp.Stdlib.Forge`, waits on one named change instead.

  A failed read becomes `{:error, detail}`, and `IxMcp.Inbox.Watcher` then
  backs off WITHOUT advancing its watermark, so a blinked tailnet loses no
  verdict.

  ## Configuration

  Unlike the inbox feeds this one is not on by default, because it cannot
  be: it names a specific machine, and this tree is public. The inbox feeds
  default to Beeper's documented loopback endpoint, which is "not anything
  specific to one machine"; a forge host is the opposite, so its identity
  crosses at deploy time only, the same way the fleet warning catalog's
  module name does in `IxMcp.Application`.

    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_CI` -- `[user@host:]<runs-dir>`, e.g.
      `root@some-host:/srv/ci/runs` for a remote forge or a bare absolute
      path when the records are on this machine. Unset means the feed never
      starts and says nothing.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_WATCH=0` turns the feed off.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_WATCH_INTERVAL_MS` overrides the 60s cadence.
    * `IX_MCP_FORGE_WATCH_BACKFILL_S` overrides how far back the FIRST sweep
      looks (default 600s). A gate run outlives a kernel restart, so a
      session that starts just after one would otherwise never hear the
      verdict of the run it was waiting on.

  Reads only. Nothing here submits, retries, or writes to the forge.
